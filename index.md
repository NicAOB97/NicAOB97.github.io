## Nic Amalia Orchard

I am an experienced researcher with a demonstrated history of working in the civic & social organisation industry. 

Stepping into the universe of data science I want to explore the revolution that is Machine Learning with its limitless possibilities and the ways it can help change the world. I want to be a part of that change, helping shape the trajectory of artificial intelligence, its alignment and governance.

Skilled in various coding languages including Python and MATLAB. With experience using visualisation software such as Tableau. I am a fast learner and am eager to continue grabbing onto programming languages, libraries, frameworks and services to integrate into my coding projects and work.
